# 🎥 yutube-videos

This repository contains source code for all the videos published on my YouTube channel [**Code to Career**](https://www.youtube.com/@Code2Career-v9m).

Each video has its own folder and may contain:

- ✅ `initial/` folder – Starter code (if applicable)
- ✅ `final/` folder – Finished code after video walkthrough

This structure helps learners follow along easily and refer to code at any stage of the tutorial.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each video will have a folder named using the following format:
[episode-XX] short-title-in-kebab-case

🔹 **Examples:**
- `[episode-01] javascript-arrays-and-methods`
- `[episode-02] html-forms-and-flexbox-layout`
- `[episode-03] build-a-todo-app-using-react`

🔹 **Folder contents:**
```bash
📁 [episode-01] javascript-arrays-and-methods
├── initial/     # Optional - Starter code
└── final/       # Completed code after tutorial

If no initial/ folder exists, the tutorial starts directly from scratch or minimal setup.
